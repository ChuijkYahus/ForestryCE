/**
 * Covers a solar array noticing that one of its panels has been shaded.
 * <p>
 * A panel's {@code IN_DAYLIGHT} state is what the engine counts to decide how much power to make, so it has to track
 * the sky in something close to real time. It used to be refreshed only from {@code SolarPanelBlock.randomTick}, which
 * for any one block averages {@code 4096 / randomTickSpeed} ticks — about 68 seconds at the default speed, with no
 * upper bound. Building a roof over an array therefore kept paying out for a minute or more, and because the engine's
 * count was maintained by incrementing and decrementing rather than recounting, any missed update stayed wrong.
 * <p>
 * The rig is built at absolute coordinates in open air rather than inside the test plot. GameTest buries its plots
 * deep underground, with no sky access at all, and on 1.20.1 the plot sits under an ocean so a shaft dug up to the
 * surface simply refills with water and blocks sky light. Building above sea level and clearing the panel's own
 * column sidesteps whatever terrain the plot happens to be under. The rig is torn down again at the end.
