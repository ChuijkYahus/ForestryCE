/**
 * Regression suite for the minifarm doing its work for free.
 * <p>
 * {@link forestry.core.platform.tile.TilePowered} charges for work in steps. It draws one step's worth of energy while
 * the work counter is below {@code stepsPerWorkCycle}, calls {@code workCycle} once the counter reaches it, and resets
 * the counter only when {@code workCycle} reports that a cycle finished. {@code AbstractMinifarmBlockEntity.workCycle}
 * threw away the result of {@code FarmManager.doWork} and always returned false, so the counter stayed pinned at the
 * top after the first cycle. That stopped every further energy draw while still running the farm every step.
 * <p>
 * Both tests drive the pending produce branch of {@code FarmManager.doWork}, which reports work done as soon as one
 * stack moves into the product inventory. That keeps the farm off soil, water and fertilizer setup, and leaves the
 * work cycle itself as the only thing under test.
