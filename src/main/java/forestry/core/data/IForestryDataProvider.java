 * compile classpath enforces what this indirection only asks of it.
 *
 * <p>Implementations are listed in
 * {@code META-INF/services/forestry.core.data.IForestryDataProvider}, in the source set the
 * implementation is compiled from. A jar naming a class it does not carry puts that class's package in
 * two modules and the module layer refuses to build.
